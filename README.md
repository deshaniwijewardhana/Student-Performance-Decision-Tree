Mini project for predicting student performance using Decision Tree
# Student Performance Prediction Using Decision Tree

## Project Overview
This mini project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on academic and behavioral factors using a Decision Tree classifier.

## Dataset
- Attendance Percentage
- Midterm Marks
- Assignment Score
- Study Hours per Week
- Previous GPA
- Final Result (Pass / Fail)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Machine Learning Model
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results
The model achieved good accuracy and demonstrates how decision trees can be used in educational performance prediction.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `Student_Performance.csv`
3. Run all cells
